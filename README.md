## üîπ 1. What is _Big O Notation_?

### Answer

**Big O notation** serves as a standardized **measure for algorithmic performance**, focusing on time and space complexity. It's crucial for **comparing algorithms** and understanding their **scalability**.

### Key Concepts

- **Dominant Term**: The notation simplifies complexity expressions to their most significant terms, making them easier to compare.

- **Asymptotic Analysis**: Big O emphasizes how algorithms perform as data scales, offering a high-level understanding of efficiency.

- **Worst-Case Performance**: Big O provides an upper limit on resources needed, offering a conservative estimate for the most challenging scenarios.


### Visual Representation

### Complexity Classes

- **Constant Complexity** $O(1)$
  - Resources used are independent of the input size.
  - Time Example: Arithmetic operations, Array index access
  - Space Example: Using a fixed-size array
  
- **Logarithmic Complexity** $O(\log n)$
  - Resource usage grows logarithmically with input size.
  - Time Example: Binary search in a sorted array
  - Space Example: Binary tree traversal
  
- **Linear Complexity** $O(n)$
  - Resource usage scales linearly with input size.
  - Time Example: Element search in an unordered list
  - Space Example: Allocating an array proportional to input size
  
- **Linearithmic Complexity** $O(n\log n)$
  - Resource usage grows at a rate between linear and quadratic. Often seen when combining linear and logarithmic operations.
  - Time Example: Efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort
  - Space Example: Divide-and-conquer algorithms that decompose the problem
  
- **Quadratic Complexity** $O(n^2)$
  - Resources scale with the square of the input size.
  - Time Example: Algorithms with simple nested loops, e.g., bubble sort
  - Space Example: Creating a two-dimensional matrix based on input size
  
- **Exponential Complexity** $O(2^n)$
  - Resource usage doubles (or increases exponentially) with each additional unit of input.
  - Time Example: Generating all subsets of a set
  - Space Example: Recursive algorithms that double the size of the call stack for each input element

### Practical Applications

1. **Resource Management**: It helps in pre-allocating sufficient resources, especially in constrained environments.
2. **Reliability**: Provides a performance guarantee, crucial in time-sensitive tasks.
3. **Optimization**: Aids in identifying bottlenecks and areas for potential improvement, ensuring the algorithm is as efficient as possible.

### Code Example: Linear Search

Here is the Python code:

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if num == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

- **Worst-Case**: The target is not in the list, resulting in $O(n)$ time complexity.
- **Best-Case**: The target is the first element, with $O(1)$ time complexity.
- **Average-Case**: Simplifies to $O(n)$ as every element has an equal chance of being the target.

## üîπ 2. What is an _Algorithm_?

### Answer

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. It starts with an input, performs a series of well-defined steps, and produces an output. Mathematically, this process can be denoted as $A: I \rightarrow O$.

### Core Characteristics of Algorithms

- **Determinism**: The same input will always produce the same output.
  
- **Finiteness**: The algorithm should terminate after a finite number of steps.
  
- **Effectiveness**: The algorithm must accomplish the task it's designed for.

- **Expressibility**: Can be described using natural language, flowcharts, pseudocode, or code.

### Categories of Algorithms

Algorithms can be grouped into several paradigms, each with its unique approach to problem-solving:

1. **Greedy**: Takes the best immediate choice.
2. **Divide and Conquer**: Splits the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Solves overlapping subproblems.
4. **Backtracking**: Takes steps back when a solution path proves incorrect.
5. **Brute Force**: Examines all possibilities.

### Code Example: Greedy Algorithm for Knapsack Problem

Here is the Python code:

```python
def knapsack_greedy(W, wt, val):
    items = sorted(zip(wt, val), key=lambda x: x[1]/x[0], reverse=True)
    knapsack, capacity = [], W
    for wt, val in items:
        if wt <= capacity:
            knapsack.append((wt, val))
            capacity -= wt
    return knapsack

W, wt, val = 10, [2,3,4,5], [3,4,5,6]
print(knapsack_greedy(W, wt, val))
```

---

## üîπ 3. Explain _O(log n) Logarithmic_ time complexity.

### Answer

The $O(\log n)$ time complexity indicates that the algorithm's runtime grows **logarithmically** with the input size $n$. Mathematically, this is represented as $f(n) \leq c \cdot \log n$, where $c$ is a positive constant. 

**Logarithmic** time complexity offers efficient performance, especially as the input size increases.

### Examples of Logarithmic Behavior

1. **Binary Decision**: Binary Search and tree-based strategies, like Balanced Binary Trees, halve the problem space with each step.
   
2. **Divide and Conquer**: Methods like Merge Sort and Quick Sort partition data, processing partitions separately, achieving logarithmic reductions.

3. **Efficient Lookups**: Balanced trees, such as AVL and Red-Black, ensure logarithmic complexities for search, insertion, and deletion.

### Visual Representation

When plotted on a graph, $\log(n)$ increases at a diminishing rate as $n$ grows. The curve starts steep but flattens out as $n$ becomes larger, indicating a slower rate of growth.

### Code Example: Binary Search

Here is the Python code:

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1
```

## üîπ 4. Explain _O(n2) Quadratic_ time complexity.

### Answer

When an algorithm exhibits $O(n^2)$ time complexity, its execution time grows **quadratically** with the input size $n$. This means that if the input size doubles, the running time would roughly quadruple.

While such quadratic growth is **generally inefficient** for larger inputs, it's not uncommon in specific algorithms or scenarios.

### Visual Representation

Visualize a square grid where each cell represents a unit of work. For an $O(n^2)$ algorithm, the entire grid, which has $n$ cells on each side, would be filled out.

![Quadratic Complexity](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/dev-stack-app.appspot.com/o/big-o%2FO(n2)%20table%203-3%20(1).png?alt=media&token=2ff9ca69-cc48-4ef8-a3f4-8727fe9b9810)

### Examples of Quadratic Behavior

1. **Nested Loops**: Often, when we encounter nested loops where each iteration of the outer loop leads to $n$ iterations of the inner loop, it results in $n \times n$ operations.

2. **Element Comparisons**: Sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort or Selection Sort involve comparing elements multiple times, leading to $O(n^2)$ complexity.

### Practical Applications

- **Sorting**: Despite their inefficiency, quadratic algorithms like Bubble Sort or Selection Sort are taught due to their simplicity.
  
- **Pair Calculations**: For tasks like identifying all unique pairs from a set of $n$ elements or finding pairs of integers in an array that sum up to a specific value. Both tasks typically use nested loops or pairwise comparisons, leading to quadratic time complexity.

### Code Example: Bubble Sort

Here is the Python code:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1. Swap if the element found is greater
            # than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Sample Usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original Array:", arr)

bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted Array:", arr)
```

This code demonstrates the $O(n^2)$ behavior, particularly when you consider that in the **worst-case scenario** (a reversely sorted array), the inner loop will run a maximum number of times for every iteration of the outer loop.

## üîπ 5. Explain _O(n!) Factorial_ time complexity.

### Answer

The $O(n!)$ notation signals an algorithm whose performance grows **factorially** with the input size $n$. Such algorithms are **exceedingly slow** and are generally impractical for larger datasets.

### Factorial Basics

A **factorial**, denoted as $n!$, represents the product of all positive integers up to $n$:

$$
n! = n \times (n - 1) \times \ldots \times 1
$$

This has serious computational implications. For instance, $5!$ means 120 operations, but $10!$ implies a whopping 3,628,800 operations.

### Examples of Factorial Behavior

1. **Permutations**: Generating all possible permutations of a list involves $O(n!)$ operations, as every element can be paired with every other element, recursively.

2. **Traveling Salesman Problem**: A brute-force solution to this famous problem tries all possible combinations to find the shortest path through several cities. The complexity is factorial due to the number of ways to arrange the cities.

### Practical Applications

While algorithms with factorial time complexities are rarely used in practice due to their inefficiency, they can still be found in:

- **Optimization Problems**: Where an exact solution is necessary, like the Traveling Salesman Problem, even if this approach is often impractical for larger inputs.
  
- **Computational Biology**: Some protein structure prediction methods, for instance, might require exploring an enormous number of configurations.

### Code Example: Generating Permutations

Here is the Python code:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Generate all permutations of a list
def generate_permutations(lst):
    return list(permutations(lst))

# Sample Usage
print(generate_permutations([1, 2, 3]))
```

For a list of 3 elements, there are 6 permutations. But for 5 elements, there are 120 permutations, demonstrating the **sharp growth rate** associated with factorial complexity.
